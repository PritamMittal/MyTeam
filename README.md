In addition to video calling, the app also constitutes a real-time chat app. Furthermore, the application works as a room wherein the chats **persist pre- and post-the-video-calling (adapt feature by Microsoft)**. People in the same room link can swiftly shift between chat app and video calling app.

What sets this app apart from existing video calling platforms is that it is custom made for users belonging to different age groups and with distinct purpose of meeting. For children/amicable meetings there is **My Teams Jr.** which comprises the features of My Teams along with certain exclusive features like interactive games and fun activities.
